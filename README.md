## Overview 

This project is for the [LPC1768](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/) microcontroller, which is on the accessories board at the back of UBC Supermileage Electric Urban vehicle. This microcontroller handles CAN messages to control all accessories (lights, signals, ...), and also handles throttle messages to control the motorspeed via PWM.

## Building

Insure you have all the tools installed listed below in the "Tools" section

Recussivly clone the repo to get submodules
```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/supermileage/mbedAccessories.git
```

* NOTE: If you make any changes to the mbedCanLib then make sure to commit and push those before you commit and push mbedSteeting to insure mbedCanLib stays consistent throughout the project

Navigate into the repo and run the following command to install the mbed libraries
```sh
$ mbed deploy
```

If this is your first time using mbed, navigate to mbed-os folder, and run (make sure you are in your virtual env)
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next navigate back to project root, and run
```sh
$ mbed new .
```

Then set up the target and toolchain
```sh
$ mbed target -m lpc1768 
$ mbed toolchain -t GCC_ARM 
```

Now open the project in VSCode, and go the launch.json. Change the 2 lines with the comment 'CHANGE', to the location of your 'arm-none-eabi-gdb' and 'pyocd-gdbserver'.
The pyocd-server will be located inside the virtualenv (if you followed instructions from tools section below), so for you '.../mbedEnv/bin/pyocd-gdbserver' (fill in the ... with the actual path)

You should be able to plug in the LPC1768 and debug. Please read the comments about breakpoints and wait() at the top of main.cpp (Annoying bugs)

Alternativly if you choose not to debug (debugging takes awhile to start), then you can run
```sh
$ mbed compile
```

Then drag the bin file within "GCC-ARM" folder in the project into the LPC1768


## Tools (for mac)

First, insure you have the arm toolchain arm-none-eabi-gdb installed, you can check this with
```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb
```

Install it if you don't have it already (assuming you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed)
```sh
$ brew tap ArmMbed/homebrew-formulae
$ brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

Then, install `virtualenv`, which allows you to isolate python environments:
```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Next, create a virtual environment, anything you install with pip will go in here
```sh
$ virtualenv mbedCanEnv
```

Enter that virtualenv
```sh
$ source mbedCanEnv/bin/activate
```

You can leave this environment at any point with
```sh
$ deactivate
```

Now install the mbed command line interface (mbed-cli)
```sh
$ pip install mbed-cli
```
